## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- In this challenge I learned about implementing font awesome and also about using the background-size property's contain and cover values to work with the mobile version and the dektop version of the landing page.

### Continued development

- I hope that I can get used to use the background-size property since it took me some time in order figure out how to make the background picture to have a full size.

### Useful resources

- [Kevin Powell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3T_Jy1CqH9k) - I learned about "background-size: contain;" from here.
